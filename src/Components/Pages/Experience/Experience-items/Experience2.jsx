          Before I started learning about Web Development, after 8+ years
          working in sales, I wanted to take some time and think about my
          future.
        </li>
        <li>
          So in this period of time I continued researching some areas that for
          some time interested me.
        </li>
        <li>
          Among other things, the list included programming, Forex trading and
          starting an online business on Amazon, for the former actually taking
          an online class and started my research.
